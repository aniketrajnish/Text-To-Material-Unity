Generate a Unity Standard Shader material with the following characteristics: {0}. Please provide the material properties in the following format: Albedo: [r g b a], Metallic: [value], Smoothness: [value], Emission: [r g b a]. For Tiling and Offset, provide two values separated by a space, in the format 'x y'. Example format for Tiling and Offset: 'Tiling: 1 1', 'Offset: 0 0'. Please provide the material properties in the specified format without brackets. For example: Albedo: 1 0 0 1, Metallic: 1, Smoothness: 1, Emission: 1 1 1 0, Tiling: 10 10, Offset: 0 0
Craft a high-quality, seamlessly tileable texture based on these attributes: {0}. The texture should be designed for flawless tiling in 3D environments, ensuring that when repeated, the edges align perfectly without any visible seams, interruptions, or discrepancies. To do this the left edge of the image should align with the right edge and the top edge should align with the bottom edge.  Additionally, the texture needs to be evenly illuminated and in high resolution, suitable for detailed rendering and close-up views, free from any pixelation or quality loss
