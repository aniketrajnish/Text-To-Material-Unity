Generate a Unity Standard Shader material with the following characteristics: {0}. Please provide the material properties in the following format: Albedo: [r g b a], Metallic: [value], Smoothness: [value], Emission: [r g b a]. For Tiling and Offset, provide two values separated by a space, in the format 'x y'. Example format for Tiling and Offset: 'Tiling: 1 1', 'Offset: 0 0'. Please provide the material properties in the specified format without brackets. For example: Albedo: 1 0 0 1, Metallic: 1, Smoothness: 1, Emission: 1 1 1 0, Tiling: 10 10, Offset: 0 0
Create a high-quality, strictly seamless texture that can be tiled flawlessly for a 3D material, matching these characteristics: {0}. The texture must have absolutely no visible seams or discontinuities, ensuring it can be tiled repeatedly without any noticeable edges. It should also be evenly lit and high-resolution to support close-up views and detailed rendering without pixelation.
